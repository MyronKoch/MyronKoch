# Myron Koch  
**AI Engineer • Systems Architect • MCP Toolsmith • Blockchain Automation Researcher**

I build natural-language automation layers over complex systems — blockchains, agents, terminals, and local models — with a focus on local-first engineering and real-world orchestration. My work bridges advanced AI tooling with practical software workflows, creating systems that feel intuitive, fast, and powerful.

### 🧠 What I Work On
- **Agentic systems + multi-agent coordination**
- **MCP servers** (blockchain tools, orchestration layers, memory systems)
- **Local-first AI pipelines** (Ollama, LM Studio, FastAPI, Rust, Node)
- **Terminal automation** using natural language interfaces
- **Blockchain integrations** (Cosmos SDK, EVM ecosystems, Solana, and custom tooling)
- **Large-context analysis + model-assisted research**
- **Voice interfaces + realtime interaction models**

### 🚀 Notable Projects
- **Blockchain MCP Server Suite**  
  A large collection of chain-specific and chain-agnostic MCP servers enabling direct natural-language interaction with blockchain infrastructure.

- **MCP Server that Builds MCP Servers**  
  A generative toolchain that scaffolds new blockchain-focused MCP servers following a published standard.

- **Multi-Agent TMUX Orchestrator**  
  A coordinator agent that spins up a tmux session, manages six specialized sub-agents, and performs collaborative workflows inside a live terminal.

- **BMCPS.dev Standard**  
  A naming and structural standard for blockchain MCP tooling.

I build systems that reduce complexity, increase velocity, and let humans interact with technology the way they think — directly, conversationally, and without friction.
